# AI does AI Episode 2: Romance and Autocomplete 

This repository is a supplement to my video on AI-based autocomplete tools as part of my series AI does AI (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdsEeFmbOyw) 

 👁 The focus of this particular video and project was to learn about various ML and non-ML approached to implement a autocomplete feature that will complete sentences based on a seed input.
 
 🤖 The concepts/models used in this project are Markov Chains, RNNs, and LSTMs.
